I will be presenting a session on VMware NSX at the 21st Belgian VMUG meeting on the 21st of November in Antwerp. You can register for it here.

The VMUG crew did an excellent job in getting an amazing line-up of speakers including (in no particular order) Chris Wahl, Cormac Hogan, Mike Laverick, Duncan Epping, Eric Sloof, and Luc Dekens. Besides being able to meet these guys you can also participate in Mikeâ€™s VMworld 2014 SwagBag (EVO:RAIL edition) charity raffle.

Running the best virtualization software AND donating to charity, thatâ€™s double Karma points right there ðŸ˜‰
