I often find myself watching and rewatching documentaries related to my field(s) of interest, mainly the IT industry, and (computer) science in general. I find that doing so provides a certain inspiration to start tinkering with something new, or often times just to keep pushing. I’ve compiled a list of documentaries below that I hope you’ll find useful, either for your own inspiration or just because they are enjoyable and informational. If you feel that things are missing on this list, and I hope you do, please DM me on Twitter and I’ll come back and update it.

**Code Rush**

**General Magic**

GENERAL MAGIC is the untold tale of how a great vision and epic failure changed the world. The ideas that dominate the tech industry and our day to day lives were born at a secretive Silicon Valley start-up called ‘General Magic’, which spun out of Apple in 1990 to create the “next big thing”. General Magic shipped the first handheld personal communicator (or “smartphone”) in 1994. Featuring legendary members of the original Macintosh team, along with the creators of the iPod, iPhone, Android, and eBay, the film combines rare archival footage with contemporary stories of the “Magicians” today. This is the story of one of history’s most talented tech teams and what happens when those who have a dream to change the world fail, fail again, fail better, and ultimately succeed.
