I attended the Microsoft Community Event Experts Live Netherlands this week and came away impressed by the strength and diversity of the Microsoft Community and it's ecosystem. The event was extremely well organized and had some great content and speakers.

From the Rubrik side I presented a session on how Rubrik provides cyber resilience for Microsoft environments, I first blogged about how Rubrik provides data management for Microsoft in 2017 (https://filipv.net/rubrik-and-microsoft-rest-assured/) and we sure came a long way since then.

Currently we provide both data security posture and cyber recovery capabilities for Microsoft, combining both to achieve cyber resilience.
