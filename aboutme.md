Hi there!

My name is Filip Verloy, you’ve reached my personal blog where I mainly write about technology related to my employer [noname security](https://nonamesecurity.com) and the rest of the IT industry.

I’ve worked for VMware, Rubrik, Riverbed, Nuage Networks, Dell, Citrix, and several VARs in the past. I like to understand the fundamentals behind technology, like the late great Stephen Hawking said “the greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge”.

I'm also a member of the [StackGuardian](https://www.stackguardian.io) advisory board and a technologist at heart, intrinsically motivated to learn and explain technology.

I enjoy public speaking and sharing knowledge (hence this blog) but most importantly being challenged and learning on a daily basis. If you see me at an event please come up and say hi, always looking to connect, and learn from different people.

Although I mainly blog about technology that is related to my employer, it is in no way endorsed or approved by my employer and all opinions are solely my own.
