Hi there!

My name is Filip Verloy, you’ve reached my personal blog where I mainly write about technology related to my employer noname security and the rest of the IT industry.

I’ve worked for VMware, Rubrik, Riverbed, Nuage Networks, Dell, Citrix, and several VARs in the past. I like to understand the fundamentals behind technology, like the late great Stephen Hawking said “the greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge”.

I enjoy public speaking and sharing knowledge (hence this blog) but most importantly being challenged and learning on a daily basis. If you see me at an event please come up and say hi, always looking to connect, and learn from different people.

I was recentely awarded Cisco Champion 2018, and have been a vExpert since 2014. I hold a plethora (= too many to keep current) of industry certifications (see Linkedin for more info).

Although I mainly blog about technology that is related to my employer, it is in no way endorsed or approved by my employer and all opinions are solely my own.

You can also find me on Twitter or Linkedin
